# Horizontal-Pod-Autoscalling :

* It is the object in kubernetes that can be scale pods based on observes CPU utilization.
* Scalling can be done for scalable object like controller, deployment and replicaset 
* Before HPA we need to download the Metric server on cluster that will provide the all the pods utilization of CPU and memory to the HPA.

Kubectl autoscale deployment mydev --cpu-percent=20 --min=1 --max=10

mydev = It is object name
