Service : It is an abstraction that defines a set of pods and a policy for accessing those pods. It provides a stable endpoint (IP address and port) that allows other applications
           or services within or outside of the Kubernetes cluster to communicate with the pods, even as they are created, scaled, or replaced.

USes for = Services act as an abstraction layer above pods. While pods are relatively ephemeral and can come and go as they are created, updated, or scaled, services provide a 
           stable and consistent way to access a group of pods.

 Example :

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-web-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-web-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
