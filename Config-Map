# Config-Map 

[ Problems without config-map ]
      = While performing application deployment on kub8 cluster, we need to change the application configuration file depend on environments like QA, Dev, stage and Prod.
      * Changing the app config file means we need to change source code , commit the change, creating a new image and then go through the complete deployment proccess .

[ Solution ]
      = In kubernetes ConfigMap handle this situation . It allow us to handle configuration file much more easy way. We can store our all confugration file in ConfigMap object 
         and deploy that file with a partciular config file in deployment.

How you can use ?
= kubectl create conifgmap [myapp] [abc.conifg]

myapp = It is a Configmap object file 
abc.config = It is a Configuration file for application 

Configuration file can accessed by container in follwing wasys 

1 : As volumes in pod 
2 : As environment in pod
