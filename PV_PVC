# Persistent Volume :

Why we need Persistent Volume?
  = When in kubernetes run a container it crash and build another new container it automatically loose the data that are present or used by pervious container , For Solving this issue 
    Persistent Volume come in the picture 

How to use this Persistent volume?
  = It represents a piece of storage that is abstracted from the underlying infrastructure. Pods can then claim and use these persistent volumes without needing to know where the storage 
    physically resides. Kubernetes takes care of mapping the PV to an appropriate storage resource and ensuring that the data is accessible to the pods that need it.

PERSISTENT VOLUME
================================
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: myebsvol
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Recycle
  awsElasticBlockStore:
    volumeID:           # YAHAN APNI EBS VOLUME ID DAALO
    fsType: ext4
=================================


# PersistentVolume Claim :
      The PVC request a PV with your desired specification ( Size, AccessMode, Speed ) from kubernetes and Once a suitable peristent volume is found it is bound to a perisitent volume.

==================================
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: myebsvolclaim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

===================================

NOw you can deploy your application with peristent volume with attach your deployment :

==================================================================================
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pvdeploy
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:      # tells the controller which pods to watch/belong to
    matchLabels:
     app: mypv
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mypv
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: shell
        image: centos
        command: ["bin/bash", "-c", "sleep 10000"]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: mypd
          mountPath: "/tmp/persistent"
      volumes:
        - name: mypd
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: myebsvolclaim
