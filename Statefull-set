Statefull-Set : A StatefulSet is a Kubernetes resource object that is used to manage stateful applications in a clustered environment, such as databases and other distributed systems.
                Unlike a Deployment, which manages stateless applications, a StatefulSet provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of pods. Each pod in a StatefulSet has a
                unique, stable network identity and persistent storage, which makes it suitable for applications that require stable network hostnames, ordered scaling, and 
                data persistence.

Uses : Use a StatefulSet to deploy your database. A StatefulSet ensures that each pod (database instance) has a stable network identity and a unique hostname.
