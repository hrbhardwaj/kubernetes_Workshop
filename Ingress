Ingress : In Kubernetes, an Ingress is an API object that manages external access to services within a cluster. It provides a way to configure the routing of external traffic to 
          various services based on hostnames, paths, and other HTTP request attributes. Essentially, an Ingress acts as a traffic controller for incoming requests.

Uses : Before you can use Ingress resources, you need to have an Ingress controller installed and running in your Kubernetes cluster. Popular Ingress controllers include Nginx Ingress
        Controller, Traefik, and Istio. Install and configure the Ingress controller according to its documentation.
